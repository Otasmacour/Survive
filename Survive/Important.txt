What can be used, but if it won´t, then it will probably be removed when the project is completed:
 -Method "SearchAdjacentCharacter" in MapHelper
 -If statement"if(door.destinationMap != null)" in method "PerformCharacterMove"
 -Lots of things(methods) in DataIOManager
Better explain StopWatches in Controller
For presentation
 -I have to make a diagram of monster movement
