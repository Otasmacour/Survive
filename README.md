This is what the game looks like from a player's perspective.  
# Monster's modes
Monster has 3 modes:
- Walking, the most common, simply walks through the house and moves around random rooms.  
- Chasing, this mode is triggered when the monster spots the player, and when it spots the player, the monster chases the player around the room.  
- Searching, this last mode is triggered when the monster is in chase mode but the player escapes to another room, then the monster searches nearby rooms for a while until it gets tired of it, and there is a chance during this mode that it will search the closets in the room it is in.  
# Hints and Gameplay
 - The volume and frequency of the heartbeat tells the player the distance of the monster.
 - The monster is 7 feet tall, so the secret tunnel is too low for it to enter.  
 - If the player makes a noise that the monster can hear from the distance where it is, the monster will come.
 - In addition to gradually unlocking the main door (in this case just stand in front of it), for all chests or other objects where an item is used, the player must stand right where the chest/whatever is located, just like when collecting items.
 - if you shoot the monster, you have two minutes before the monster respawns in the basement
 - What specific items are used for is pretty intuitive in my opinion, especially with the alerts that pops up when a player uses an item the wrong way, plus I don't want to spoil it, so you can figure it out on your own.
   
For almost all items you'll see the names, but for some things where it doesn't make sense, it doesn't show, so to make sure you don't get lost, here's an explanation:  
  - **Monster:** `A`
  - **Player:** `T`
  - **Wall:** `x`
  - **Door:** `d`
  - **Secret Door:** `s`
  - **Closet:** `c`
  - **Floor:** `.`
# Important
 - as I already hinted when I mentioned the heartbeat, there are sounds in the game for almost all actions the player can perform, so turn on the sound on your computer!!
